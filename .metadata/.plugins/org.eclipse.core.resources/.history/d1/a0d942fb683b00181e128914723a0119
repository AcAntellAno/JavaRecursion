/*
 * Linear search in an unsorted array we have to iterate through the whole
 * array sequentially...checking every item => O(N) time 
 * 
 * Binary Search we can do better if the array is sorted
 * It finds the position of a target value within a sorted array
 * O(log N) time
 * 
 * How binary search works: we can start by comparing the target value to the value
 * of the middle element of the sorted array:
 * 			-if this element is greater than the item we are looking for:
 * 				we continue the search on the right subarray
 * 			-if the element is less => we search the left subarray
 * 
 * Why is it good? We can discard half of the items on every iteration
 * which would be logarithmic time complexity (if array is not sorted than we cannot
 * do better than linear search)
 * 
 * Interpolation Search: can use it if the array is sorted. 
 * It is like when we look through a telephone book
 * 		-we make a guess where in the item we are looking for might be
 * 		- in binary search we jump to the middle index...here this is not the case
 * 		- we just make a simple linear interpolation
 * This is O(log log N) comparisons
